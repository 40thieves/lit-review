# Conclusion

* "The potential for what we currently call altmetrics is nothing short of a complete map of scholarly activity and influence" (Exploring the Boundaries: How Altmetrics Can Expand Our Vision of Scholarly Communication and Social Impact; Taylor; 2013)

* Scholarly usage is increasing
	* Social media scholarly usage is low currently, but is likely to increase
	* All communication is going online, so we should adapt to measure these outputs
		* Especially as it's (somewhat) easier due to APIs

* Altmetrics just a filter
	* Ultimately peer review & impact factors are merely filters for trusted information
		* Take all information, filter it out in various ways to get information that is trustworthy and valuable
		* Altmetrics offer an alternative filter, that can give a different perspective on what information is trustworthy & valuable
		* "Our only options are to publish less or to filter more effectively, and any response that favours publishing less doesn't make sense, either logistically, financially, or ethically" (Article Level Metrics and the Evolution of Scientific Impact; Neylon & Wu; 2009)
		* Mention Clay Shirky's "Not Information Overload, But Filter Failure"?

* Replacement for IF
	* Should traditional methods be replaced? No - they still offer a useful filter (especially for trustworthy information)
		* Hierarchy of information
	* "Ultimately, users must frame appropriate questions and decide what information they want the altmetrics data to provide" (New perspectives on article-level metrics: developing ways to assess research uptake and impact online; Liu & Adie; 2013)

* Altmetrics more nuanced
	* "Metrics must move beyond simply reporting counts" (Altmetrics in the Wild: Using Social Media to Explore Scholarly Impact; Priem, Piwowar, Hemminger; 2012)
	* Instead of simply calculating a somewhat meaningless number, can should provide context
		* That's why diversity is key - telling story more important than raw numbers
	* "One important aspect of this is our ability to establish thoughtful and meaningful ways of grouping similar altmetrics together and distinguishing them from other altmetrics with different meaning" (Altmetrics in Evolution: Defining and Redefining the Ontology of Article-Level Metrics; Liu & Fenner; 2013)
		* Categorisation provides context
	* "Combining article-level metrics into a single score defeats one of the advantages of article-level metrics over the traditional journal impact factor" (Consuming Article-Level Metrics: Observations and Lessons; Chamberlain; 2013)
		* "If article-level metrics are to avoid the pitfalls of the Journal Impact Factor, we should strive for meaningful article-level metrics, important to different stakeholders, that retain their context"
	* "The tendency to desire one single score to evaluate research is one of laziness" (Altmetrics: Rethinking the Way We Measure; Galligan & Dyas-Correia; 2013)

* Openness
	* Methods of calculation "should be very clear and accessible" (Consuming Article-Level Metrics: Observations and Lessons; Chamberlain; 2013)
		* Including in API documentation
	* Galligan & Dyas-Correia (2013) cite:
		* "The impact factor [is] one of the main culprits in the creation of a roadblock to open access" (Sick of Impact Factors; Curry; 2012)

* Altmetrics increases outreach
	* "The increasing strength of altmetrics will be to increase the detail and scope of the description of research in society" (Exploring the Boundaries: How Altmetrics Can Expand Our Vision of Scholarly Communication and Social Impact; Taylor; 2013)
		* As scientists can demonstrate impact on society, competition will increase, leading to greater outreach

* Further research
	* "Much work to expand this research will center around reducing noise that obscures the impact signal – or, more accurately, isolating and identifying different types of impacts on different audiences" (Altmetrics in the Wild: Using Social Media to Explore Scholarly Impact; Priem, Piwowar, Hemminger; 2012)
	* "[Future work is] crucial to understand what the events informing alternative metrics actually mean" (Altmetrics in the Wild: Using Social Media to Explore Scholarly Impact; Priem, Piwowar, Hemminger; 2012)
		* Events happening over time, including after publication - so we need to study how impact changes over time
			* Time periods studied at the moment - a week after publication and years after publication
	* "Determining meaningful clusters of metrics for particular groups" (Altmetrics: Rethinking the Way We Measure; Galligan & Dyas-Correia; 2013)
		* e.g. which metrics are relevant for librarians, for the public, for researchers in the topic area
		* Could be applied to impact over time too
	* Impact over time
	* Network effects
		* "[Future work should] take network properties into effect, … a tweet from a highly-connected, expert scholar should mean something different from one authored by a casual observer" (Altmetrics in the Wild: Using Social Media to Explore Scholarly Impact; Priem, Piwowar, Hemminger; 2012)
	* Other scholarly output
		* "Investigation should also expand to examine altmetrics for scholarly products other than articles" (Altmetrics in the Wild: Using Social Media to Explore Scholarly Impact; Priem, Piwowar, Hemminger; 2012)
			* "Datasets, software, and blog posts"
