# Final Year Project
### Lit Review - Conclusion

* Include universities, funding institutions into why altmetrics matters

* [Altmetrics in the Wild: Using Social Media to Explore Scholarly Impact; Priem, Piwowar, Hemminger; 2012](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4745)
	* "Much work to expand this research will center around reducing noise that obscures the impact signal – or, more accurately, isolating and identifying different types of impacts on different audiences"
	* "[Future work will involve] sampling from different journals and publishers"
	* "[Future work is] crucial to understand what the events informing alternative metrics actually mean"
	* "Metrics must move beyond simply reporting counts"
		* "[Future work should] take network properties into effect, … a tweet from a highly-connected, expert scholar should mean something different from one authored by a casual observer"
	* "Investigation should also expand to examine altmetrics for scholarly products other than articles"
		* "Datasets, software, and blog posts"

* Thought has moved to a more nuanced understanding of altmetrics
	* "It has become obvious that the different metrics we group together under the broader term altmetrics are indeed representing very different things"
	* Instead of simply calculating a somewhat meaningless number, can should provide context
	* That's why diversity is key - telling story more important than raw numbers
	* [Altmetrics in Evolution: Defining and Redefining the Ontology of Article-Level Metrics; Liu & Fenner; 2013](http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/2013/v25no2/lin/)
		* "One important aspect of this is our ability to establish thoughtful and meaningful ways of grouping similar altmetrics together and distinguishing them from other altmetrics with different meaning"

* [Consuming Article-Level Metrics: Observations and Lessons; Chamberlain; 2013](http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/2013/v25no2/chamberlain/)
	* Methods of calculation "should be very clear and accessible"
	* Including in API documentation
	* "Combining article-level metrics into a single score defeats one of the advantages of article-level metrics over the traditional journal impact factor"
	* "If article-level metrics are to avoid the pitfalls of the Journal Impact Factor, we should strive for meaningful article-level metrics, important to different stakeholders, that retain their context"
	* "Future work should consider further dimensions of context"
* [Exploring the Boundaries: How Altmetrics Can Expand Our Vision of Scholarly Communication and Social Impact; Taylor; 2013](http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/2013/v25no2/taylor/)
	* Work on "tracking viral communications" might be "transferrable to the field of scholarly communications"
	* "The increasing strength of altmetrics will be to increase the detail and scope of the description of research in society"
		* As scientists can demonstrate impact on society, competition will increase, leading to greater outreach
	* "The potential for what we currently call altmetrics is nothing short of a complete map of scholarly activity and influence"
* [Altmetrics: Rethinking the Way We Measure; Galligan & Dyas-Correia; 2013](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009879131300004X)
	* Cites [Sick of Impact Factors; Curry; 2012](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/)
		* Sees "the impact factor as one of the main culprits in the creation of a roadblock to open access"
	* Further work to be done on altmetrics:
		* "Determining meaningful clusters of metrics for particular groups" - e.g. which metrics are relevant for librarians, for the public, for researchers in the topic area
		* "Avoiding the mistakes made with the impact factor"
			* "The tendency to desire one single score to evaluate research is one of laziness"
			* I would add openness
		* "Realizing altmetrics are young"
			* "Longer, more systematic studies on the importance of producing impact across Web channels will undoubtedly lead to new ways for researchers and universities to disseminate and actively promote their output"

* Study/define the flavours - seem to be fairly common between various papers
   * Need for standardisation
   * System for categorising new altmetric sources into these categories
