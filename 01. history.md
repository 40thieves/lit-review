The field of bibliometrics, sometimes scientometrics, has existed for many years and has created a set of methods to quantitatively analyse scientific and technological literature [Bibliometrics and Citation Analysis: From the Science Citation Index to Cybermetrics; De Bellis; 2009].

One of the most widely used methods is the Impact Factor, sometimes the Journal Impact Factor. Proposed by Eugene Garfield in 1972, in his paper, _Citation Analysis As A Tool in Journal Evaluation_. The impact factor is calculated using the following alogrithm:

The _Journal Citation Reports_ is published annually by Thomson Reuters, listing all known journals and giving their impact factor, and other metrics for the current year. Neylon and Wu [Article-Level Metrics and the Evolution of Scientific Impact; Neylon & Wu, 2009] state that "most scientists â€¦ will point to the Thomson ISI Journal Impact Factor as an external and 'objective' measure for ranking the impact of specific journals and the individual articles within them".

Usage of the impact factor in ranking research other than journals has become more widespread. Increasingly, impact factor has become a proxy for measuring many diverse research outputs. These range from comparisons of international impact to individual article value [Cash for papers: putting a premium on publication; Fuyuno & Cyranoski; 2006]  [Nefarious Numbers; Arnold & Fowler; 2010]  [The History and Meaning of the Journal Impact Factor; Garfield; 2006]. This has lead to ranking author value, by simply totalling the impact factor of each paper published.

Because of it's wide-ranging use, the impact factor has a strong influence on the scientific community. This has affected decisions on where to publish, whom to promote or hire, the success of grant applications, library decisions to purchase and renew journal subscriptions, researchers deciding where to publish, researchers choice on what to read and even salary bonuses [Show Me The Data; Rossner, Van Epps & Hill; 2007]  [Nefarious Numbers; Arnold & Fowler; 2010].

"In some countries, government funding of entire institutions is dependent on the number of publications in journals with high impact factors" [It is time to find a better way to assess the scientific literature; The PLoS Medicine Editors; 2006]
