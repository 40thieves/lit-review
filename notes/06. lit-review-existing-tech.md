_Describe existing tech_
* ImpactStory, PLoS ALM, Altmetric.com, Plum Analytics
* Don't go too much into details of implementations

* [Consuming Article-Level Metrics: Observations and Lessons; Chamberlain; 2013](http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/2013/v25no2/chamberlain/)
	* Brings up consistency of data between altmetrics/ALM providers
		* Especially on Twitter data
		* "Twitter data is notorious for not being persistent"
		* "Either have to query the Twitter 'firehose' constantly and store data, or go through a company like Topsy (which collects Twitter data and charges customers for access) to collect tweets"
		* "ImpactStory collects tweets from Topsy, PLOS collects tweets from the Twitter firehose, and Altmetric collects tweets using a combination of the Twitter search and streaming APIs"
		* "ImpactStory provides a field named `provenance_url` with each metric data source"
			* PLoS ALM API provides a `events_url`, which is similar
			* Plum Analytics: "collect[s] alias URLs for each object for which they collect metrics"
				* "For example, for the DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0018657, they collect many URLs that point to that paper"
				* "This makes sense as a digital product is inevitably going to end up living at more than one URL"
		* Historical ALM data
			* "PLOS provides historical article-level metrics data on some of their metrics"
			* "Altmetric provides publicly available historical data on their Altmetric score"
			* "ImpactStory and Plum Analytics do not provide historical data"
			* "As more [sources] are tracked, historical data will become expensive to store, so perhaps wonâ€™t be emphasized by article-level metrics providers."
