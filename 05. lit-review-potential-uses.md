### Lit Review - Potential uses of altmetrics

* [Soft Peer Review - Taraborelli](http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/8279/1/8279.pdf)
	* "Former Nature editor Charles G. Jennings [14] summarizes the basic requirements for a scientific quality assessment system as follows (emphasis mine)
		* It must be _reliable_ it must predict the significance of a paper with a level of accuracy comparable to or better than the current journal system
		* It must produce a recommendation that is easily _digestible_, allowing busy scientists to make quick decisions about what to read
		* It must be _economical_, not only in terms of direct costs such as web operations, but also in terms of reviewer time invested
		* It must _work fast_. The peer review system produces clear cut decisions relatively quickly (in part because editors pester reviewers to deliver their reports), whereas many forms of  communal assessment such as the emergence of a statistically significant pattern of citations or expert recommendations are likely to be slow and gradual by comparison
		* It must be _resistant to 'gaming'_ by authors. Of course, savvy authors already know how to work the current system, but the separation of powers between editors and anonymous reviewers does I believe preserve some integrity to the process"
	* "It is not implausible in the long run scientific evaluation systems, in order to be sustainable, will have to become independent of scientific dissemination systems (e.g. scholarly journals run by academic publishers)"
* [How and why scholars cite on Twitter](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/meet.14504701201/full)
	* "Up-to-date metrics including Twitter citations might augment a tenure or promotion portfolio"
	* "Twitter citations could also be automatically harvested and analyzed to inform real-time article recommendation engines"
* [New perspectives on article-level metrics: developing ways to assess research uptake and impact online; Liu & Adie; 2013](http://uksg.metapress.com/content/x65747080803n616/?genre=article&id=doi%253a10.1629%252f2048-7754.79)
	* Lists several use cases
	* Use case: "Assessing uptake of a single article within a specific community"
		* Gives example of position paper published in [Annals of Internal Medicine](http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1675927)
		* "Within a week of the paper's publication, it was clear from the altmetrics data that the paper had already made an impact on its target audience"
			* i.e. faster than citation counts
		* "Roughly 47% of all tweets about the paper were sent from the United States, and approximately 20% were sent by doctors and other healthcare professionals"
		* "Influential Twitter accounts of several professional associations ... shared the article with thousands of followers"
		* "The paper was comprehensively discussed on physician-authored blogs, as well as in perspective pieces published by the mainstream news media"
	* "Not every article has an obvious online footprint of impact"
	* Use case: "Assessing a body of intellectual output"
		* "Rapid assessments about entire sets of articles can be easily achieved using existing altmetrics tools"
			* "As long as articles in the sets have unique identifiers"
	* Use case "Gaining insights into communities"
		* "Article-level metrics are emerging as excellent tools for identifying online communities"
* [A new framework for altmetrics; ImpactStory blog; 2012](http://blog.impactstory.org/2012/09/14/31524247207/)
	* Other approaches "'Use Math' to condense all of this information into just one, easy-to-understand number. Although this approach has been popular, we think it’s a huge mistake"
	* "We are not in the business of assigning relative values to different metrics"
		* "The whole point of altmetrics is that depending on the story you’re interested in, they’re all valuable"
	* "We can still show all the data ... — but we can also present context that gives it meaning"
		* "Of course, that context is always going to involve an element of subjectivity"
	* "We think it’ll be essential as we grow altmetrics from a source of numbers into a source of data-supported stories that inform real decisions"
* [Consuming Article-Level Metrics: Observations and Lessons; Chamberlain; 2013](http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/2013/v25no2/chamberlain/)
	* "Many potential uses for article-level metrics"
		* "Research" on article level metrics themselves
			* Possible to link to research on flow of info?
		* "Credit ... some scholars already put article-level metrics on their CVs"
			* "This use case will involve scholars with a wide variety of technical skills"
		* "Filtering ... scholars cannot possibly find relevant papers efficiently given that there are now tens of thousands of scholarly journals"
			* "Individual article-level metrics components can be used to filter articles"
			* "Article-level metrics ... can be used to make decisions about what papers to read and not to read"

	* Enables businesses to find "emerging research fronts and hot developments"
	* "For government, the aggregation of many data sources, including altmetrics, may provide better evidence to plan for investments, university funding, and return on investment by having a complete picture of impact"
	* "Publishers can use altmetric signals to introduce new publishing programs based on current trends"
	* "Funding bodies, grant review panels, and other key decision making groups might use altmetrics as further evidence for decisions on grant awards, university tenure"
